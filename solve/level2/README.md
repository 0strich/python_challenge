## LEVEL 2
![ocr.jpg](./ocr.jpg)

recognize the characters. maybe they are in the book, 
but MAYBE they are in the page source.

## How to solve
There's a lot of characters on code page.
```
%%$@_$^__#)^)&!_+]!*@&^}@[@%]()%+$&[(_@%+%$*^@$^!+]!&_#)_*}{}}!}_]$[%}@[{_@#_^{*
```
so you need to save this sentences to file, and find alphabet.

if you do this you'll see this.
